# Flip-Flop Blinking LED Circuit

This project is a basic flip-flop (astable multivibrator) circuit that alternately blinks two LEDs using two NPN transistors, capacitors, and resistors.

## Components Used
- 2 x NPN Transistors (e.g., BC547)
- 2 x 470Ω Resistors (LED current limiting)
- 2 x 68kΩ Resistors (timing resistors)
- 2 x 470µF Capacitors
- 2 x LEDs
- Breadboard and 9V Battery

## Working
- The circuit uses capacitor charging/discharging to turn transistors ON/OFF alternately.
- Each LED turns ON for approx. 0.7 × R × C seconds.

## What I Learned
- Timing behavior of RC circuits
- Basic transistor switching
- Practical implementation of digital logic behavior
